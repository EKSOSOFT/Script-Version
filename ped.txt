version: 1.1.3
changelog:
- Fix NUI "Failed to fetch" by using `GetParentResourceName()` and safe fetch handling.
- Add `Config.AllowedSteamHex` for per-Steam Hex, per-command permissions (supports `'*'`).
- Extend permission checks to honour Steam whitelist before group/ACE checks.
- Update `pedreset` to accept optional `PlayerID` and support server console execution.
- Keep legacy alias `pedereset <id>` for backwards compatibility.
- Small UX: clearer usage messages and success texts in both TR/EN.
